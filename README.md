# Stardew Valley Coffee Mod

### This mod aims to add a more realistic and involved process to growing, processing, and making coffee within Stardew Valley.

### Things I aim to add
- Multiple machines to make coffee with (espresso machines, pourover, etc.)
- Coffee grinders
- Various types of coffee beverages
- Coffee bean roasting (light, medium, dark)
- Coffee fruit processing (probably just natural and washed)


I expect this to not flow very well into normal Stardew gameplay so I intend to try and leave the base game coffee untouched. For non-coffee nerds this mod may be good for decoration.
